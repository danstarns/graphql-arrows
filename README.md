# graphql-arrows

Work in progress ðŸš§

Convert @neo4j/graphql type definitions into https://arrows.app/ diagram. Uses a React app with a iframe. Note the translation is only going one way typeDefs => arrows.

## Issues

1. Calculating the x & y so they do not overlap
2. Cyclic relationships

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone git@github.com:danstarns/graphql-arrows.git
```

```
$ cd graphql-arrows && npm install
```

```
$ npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4000
